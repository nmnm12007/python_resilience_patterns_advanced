### This project is to apply the learning on the Resilience Architecture that will be used in any API communication. This implements TImeout-Retry-CircuitBreaker-Bulkhead in a coordinated and structured pattern.
For the purpose of simplicity and focus, Flask based local app was used to simulate the API behaviour as it would be in real time.
This repository is intentionally frozen at a "working, partially typed" state.
Full strict typing will be completed in Phase-8 (Hardening & Libraryization).
